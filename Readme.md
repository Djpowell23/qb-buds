## Changes
- nh-keyboard to qb-input


## Note

- Heavily modified by Goobastank from BLVCKLISTED's qb-buds (original fork from qb-burgershot). 

- Added three different joints of varying strengths.

- Weed Brownies and Infused Gummies for long-term stress relief (fully configurable, default 5 mins, bigger chunks. good for banks, racing, flying, etc.)

- Three custom strains from bud to grinded weed to joint.

- Garage for company vehicle for deliveries. (need good vehicle and livery)
